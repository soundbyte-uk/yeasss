Yes, another stupid Slack script

Need an adaptor for an annoyingly constrained container environment to post stuff to Slack?

Need it to support updating messages or "reacting" to itself, when perhaps your CI system's built in support doesn't support that?

Why the hell would you?

Well, I needed it (again), and now I've written it again I never want to have to write it ever again for a third stupid time.

Specifically this wants Bourne shell (sh), curl and jq.
